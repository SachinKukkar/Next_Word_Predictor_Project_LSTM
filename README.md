# 🚀 Next Word Prediction with LSTM 🧠  

A sleek **Streamlit-based web app** that uses a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict the **next word** in a given sequence of text.  
This project demonstrates the power of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for sequence modeling and natural language processing.

## 🌟 Features  

✨ Predicts the **next possible word** given any partial sentence  
🎨 Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive and modern UI  
⚙️ Uses **TensorFlow/Keras LSTM model** trained on custom text data  
💾 Supports **saved model** and **tokenizer** loading for quick deployment
